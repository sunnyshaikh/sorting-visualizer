# Sorting Visualizer
Yay! Finally i am able to make this project **:)**

This is one of the coolest app i see as a developer and i was wanted to make this project.Hence, i learned it from many resources. It has a lot to learn about sorting algorithms and finally implementing and visualizing it makes me feel happy.

I Hope you like it's UI and functionality.
